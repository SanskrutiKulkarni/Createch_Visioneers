**CreaTech 2025 | Team Visioneers | IIT Patna**  

## 🔹 Problem Statement  
**Leveraging AI, ML, and Automation for Optimized Project Execution in Large-Scale Engineering Construction**  

Large-scale construction projects face **significant challenges** such as:  
- **Structural failures & material degradation**  
- **Unforeseen cost overruns & financial instability**  
- **Workforce shortages & logistical disruptions**  
- **Environmental risks like landslides, floods, and extreme weather**  

📌 **Our Goal:** Develop an **AI-driven risk prediction system** that provides **real-time insights** to prevent delays, mitigate risks, and enhance construction safety.

## 🔹 Our Solution: AI-Powered Risk Prediction System  
We have designed an **AI-driven risk prediction system** that continuously monitors and forecasts risks by integrating:  
✅ **Real-time structural sensor data** (detecting material stress & integrity)  
✅ **Satellite imagery (InSAR, LIDAR)** (predicting environmental risks)  
✅ **Financial market trends** (stock price impact on raw material costs)  
✅ **Workforce availability records** (predicting labor shortages)  
✅ **Logistics & supply chain analytics** (identifying transportation delays)  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
The system operates through **three core layers**:  

### **1️⃣ Data Collection Layer 📡**  
Gathers **real-time data** from:  
- **IoT Sensors** (measuring structural integrity)  
- **Satellite Feeds (InSAR, LIDAR)** (detecting environmental risks)  
- **Financial Market APIs** (tracking construction-related stock trends)  
- **Workforce Attendance Data** (predicting labor shortages)  
- **Logistics & Traffic Data** (identifying supply chain risks)  

### **2️⃣ AI Processing & Prediction Layer 🤖**  
**Multiple AI agents** analyze specific risk domains:  
- **Stock Market Agent** → Tracks financial fluctuations affecting material costs  
- **Structural Sensor Agent** → Monitors stress, vibrations, and deterioration  
- **Satellite Data Agent** → Predicts ground shifts, landslides, and climate risks  
- **Workforce Agent** → Forecasts labor shortages based on absenteeism trends  
- **Supply Chain Agent** → Monitors transportation disruptions & material delays  

These **specialized AI agents** work together to detect risk patterns **before** they become critical issues.  

### **3️⃣ Risk Assessment & Decision Layer 🚦**  
- **Aggregates** AI predictions into a **single risk level**  
- **Assigns a risk score (Low, Moderate, High)**  
- **Triggers automatic alerts** if risk **exceeds predefined thresholds**  
- **Provides mitigation strategies** to construction managers  

🔥 **Proactive risk detection enables faster decision-making, preventing delays and saving costs!**
